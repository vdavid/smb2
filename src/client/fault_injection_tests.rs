//! Fault injection: hostile-but-plausible servers.
//!
//! This class of bug survived a year of testing because nothing ever simulated
//! a server that stays connected and stops cooperating. Every failure here is
//! one that has actually been observed against real hardware — a QNAP TS-464
//! that answered nothing while TCP stayed `ESTABLISHED`, a macOS laptop
//! roaming between access points mid-copy — and none of them are reachable
//! from a mock that only replays a canned conversation.
//!
//! **Every wait in this file is bounded and panics on expiry.** A test that
//! can hang is worse than no test: it turns a red build into a wedged one, and
//! the failure this module exists to catch is a hang.
//!
//! The shared shape is [`ScriptedServer`]: a transport whose send half always
//! succeeds (the way a kernel socket buffer does after the peer has vanished)
//! and whose receive half answers according to a policy the test can change
//! mid-flight. Nothing in it ever returns an error or EOF, so a client that
//! only notices dead connections by reading one will wait forever — which is
//! precisely the bug.
