//! Durable handles: an open that outlives the connection carrying it.
//!
//! A 768-file copy to a NAS used to end at the first blip. M2 made the blip
//! visible and M3.1 made the connection come back, but a write halfway through
//! a 4 GB file still started that file over. A durable handle is what turns
//! "start again" into "carry on": the server keeps the open alive for a while
//! after the connection dies, and the client claims it back.
//!
//! ## The data-safety rule this module exists to enforce
//!
//! Reclaiming the wrong handle writes bytes into the wrong file, which is far
//! worse than a failed transfer. So a reclaim here is not "the server said
//! yes"; it is **two independent proofs**, and anything less closes the handle
//! and fails:
//!
//! 1. **The server matched our open.** The `DH2C` reconnect context carries
//!    the 16-byte `CreateGuid` this client chose at open time and the server
//!    stored with the open. MS-SMB2 § 3.3.5.9.12 makes the server compare it,
//!    so a grant means it found *this client's* open rather than something
//!    else living at the same `FileId`. This is why only SMB 3.x v2 handles
//!    are ever reclaimed — see [`crate::msg::create_context`] for why v1's
//!    `FileId`-only shape is not good enough.
//! 2. **The open still points at the same bytes.** `QUERY_INFO` for
//!    `FileInternalInformation` (MS-FSCC § 2.4.22) returns the file's index
//!    number — its inode, on a POSIX server — and `FileFsVolumeInformation`
//!    (MS-FSCC § 2.5.9) says which volume that inode belongs to, which matters
//!    because a share can span mount points and inode numbers only have to be
//!    unique within a filesystem. Both are read at open and read again after
//!    the reclaim, and both must match. This proof does not depend on the
//!    server implementing the `CreateGuid` comparison correctly, which is the
//!    point of having two.
//!
//!    Both the index number and volume serial are required. An index is only
//!    unique within its volume, so a server that will not answer either query
//!    gets a working ordinary handle but no resumable one. A zero index is the
//!    protocol's explicit "identity unavailable" value and is treated the same
//!    way.
//!
//! All of it is **compounded onto the CREATE**, so neither proof costs a round
//! trip.
//!
//! Gotcha/Why — the identity comes from `QUERY_INFO`, not from the `QFid`
//! create context, even though `QFid` answers exactly this question in one
//! field and would ride along for free. MS-SMB2 § 3.3.5.9.12 lets a server
//! reject a CREATE that carries any context *besides* the durable-reconnect
//! one, and Samba 4.20 does exactly that: `DH2C` + `QFid` comes back
//! `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND` from `smb2_create.c` before the open is even
//! looked up. A proof that only works on one side of the reconnect is no
//! proof, so both sides use the same `QUERY_INFO` instead.
//!
//! Gotcha/Why — `FileInternalInformation` (class 6) and not the tidier
//! `FileIdInformation` (class 59), which returns both halves at once: Samba
//! 4.20 answers class 59 with `STATUS_INVALID_INFO_CLASS`. Class 6 has existed
//! since SMB 2.0 and every server answers it. (Both findings verified
//! 2026-08-02 against the `smb-guest` fixture, Samba 4.20.6, `log level = 10`.)
//!
//! A server that will not answer `FileIdInformation` gets no resume from this
//! crate. That is deliberately strict, and it costs a rare restarted transfer
//! to buy the guarantee that a resumed write never lands in a stranger's file.
//!
//! ## Getting one at all
//!
//! ⚠️ The server only grants a durable handle when the CREATE also asks for a
//! batch oplock or a handle-caching lease (MS-SMB2 § 3.3.5.9.10). This module
//! asks for a batch oplock, which has a cost worth knowing about: while we
//! hold one, another client opening the same file makes the server send us an
//! oplock break and wait for our acknowledgment before letting them proceed.
//! That is why durable opens are a separate, opt-in method rather than the
//! default for every write.
//!
//! Everything here degrades quietly. A server on SMB 2.1, a server with
//! durable handles switched off, a share that declines the oplock: all of them
//! produce an ordinary working handle with no durability, never an error.
