//! Diagnostics: an in-process observability surface for a running [`SmbClient`](crate::SmbClient).
//!
//! Call [`SmbClient::diagnostics`](crate::SmbClient::diagnostics) to capture
//! a point-in-time tree of the client's negotiated parameters, credits,
//! in-flight requests, per-connection counters, and DFS cache state. Call
//! [`Connection::diagnostics`](crate::client::Connection::diagnostics) for
//! the per-connection slice.
//!
//! ## Consistency model
//!
//! Snapshots are **eventually consistent**. Each field is loaded
//! independently: the available-credits gauge, the in-flight count
//! (`waiters.len()`), and each counter are sampled at slightly different
//! moments. Sums of related fields (for example `credits.available +
//! credits.in_flight`) are **not** invariant — read each field for what it
//! says about itself, not as a coupled tuple. A consumer that wants
//! atomicity quiesces operations first.
//!
//! ## Snapshot lock order
//!
//! The snapshot acquires these locks, one at a time, in this order, never
//! across an `.await`: `crypto → waiters → dfs_trees → estimated_rtt`.
//! Each is held only as long as it takes to copy primitives out and
//! release. `params` is an `OnceLock` (wait-free read). `preauth_hasher`
//! and `receiver_task` are not touched by the snapshot.
//!
//! If you add a field that touches a new lock, **extend** this order, don't
//! reshuffle it.
//!
//! ## Counters survive teardown
//!
//! Counters live on `Arc<Inner>`, which outlives the receiver task. A
//! snapshot taken on a torn-down connection (`disconnected: true`) returns
//! the final counter values at the moment of death.
//!
//! ## Counters carry across a reconnect
//!
//! [`SmbClient::reconnect`](crate::SmbClient::reconnect) revives the existing
//! [`Connection`](crate::client::Connection) on a fresh socket rather than
//! building a new one, so `Inner` — and every counter on it — survives. The
//! numbers describe the whole life of the client's link to this server, blips
//! included, which is also what makes
//! [`MetricsSnapshot::reconnects_succeeded`] meaningful: a counter reset by the
//! event it counts would always read zero.
//!
//! Client-level counters (the [`ClientMetricsSnapshot`] on
//! [`Diagnostics::client`]) survive too; `reconnects` counts explicit
//! [`SmbClient::reconnect`](crate::SmbClient::reconnect) calls, while
//! `reconnects_succeeded` counts every revival including the automatic ones.
//!
//! See `docs/specs/diagnostics-plan.md` for the design rationale.
