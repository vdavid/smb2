//! Connection state and message exchange with actor-based routing.
//!
//! The [`Connection`] type manages a single TCP connection to an SMB server.
//! A background receiver task owns the transport's read half, demultiplexes
//! incoming frames by `MessageId`, and routes each response to the matching
//! per-request `oneshot::Sender`. The caller-thread path holds the write
//! half (guarded by its own Mutex via the transport trait) and pushes a
//! per-request `oneshot::Receiver` onto a FIFO that `receive_response`
//! pops from.
//!
//! See `docs/specs/connection-actor.md` for the full design (Phase 2).

    // ── Unsolicited oplock break tests ─────────────────────────────

    // ── Phase 2 (actor + oneshot routing) red tests ─────────────────
    //
    // These tests pin the invariants the Phase 2 refactor must establish.
    // They target the cancellation-by-drop failure mode that Phase 1's
    // `HashSet<MessageId>` demux cannot solve: when a caller's future is
    // dropped mid-flight (for example, by `tokio::task::JoinHandle::abort()`),
    // the in-flight MessageIds stay in `pending`; server responses for those
    // ids then get handed to the next caller as if they were legitimate.
    //
    // Post-Phase-2, each in-flight request carries its own `oneshot::Sender`;
    // when the caller's `Receiver` is dropped (future aborted), the receiver
    // task discards the response silently on arrival.
    //
    // These tests fail against current code (Phase 1). They must pass after
    // Phase 2 lands. See `docs/specs/connection-actor.md`.

    // ── Phase 3 (silent-discard fix) red test ───────────────────────
    //
    // Pins the invariant that an unrecoverable frame-level error
    // (decrypt failure, decompress failure, malformed header after
    // decryption) MUST NOT silently discard the frame and leave the
    // matching waiter hanging forever. The Phase 2 receiver task
    // currently `log-at-WARN + continue`s on decrypt failure — the
    // msg_id isn't recoverable from an unparseable frame, so there's
    // no waiter to notify targeted; the only correct behavior is to
    // tear down the connection and fan `Err(Disconnected)` to all
    // pending waiters.
    //
    // This test uses `tokio::time::timeout` to detect the hang: if
    // the waiter doesn't resolve within 2 seconds, it's hung (bug
    // present, test fails). Post-P3.4 fix, the waiter resolves with
    // an error before the timeout.

    /// A consumer must be able to SEE which request is hung, not just read a
    /// log line about it: a connection still serving small requests while one
    /// large write hangs looks healthy by every other diagnostic.

/// A batch oplock is the price of a durable handle (MS-SMB2 § 3.3.5.9.10): the
/// server will not promise to keep an open alive across a disconnect without
/// one. The cost lands on *other* clients — while we hold it, anyone else
/// opening the file waits for the server's break timeout (~35 s on Samba and
/// Windows) unless we answer. So we answer immediately and give the oplock up.
///
/// Giving it up costs the handle its durability (MS-SMB2 § 3.3.4.6), which is
/// the right trade: a resumable transfer is worth less than not freezing
/// somebody else's file operation for half a minute. The loss surfaces
/// honestly at reclaim time as [`crate::error::DurableLoss::Expired`], and the
/// transfer restarts.
///
/// Sent on its own task and never awaited: the receiver loop must get back to
/// reading, and nothing downstream depends on the acknowledgment's response.
