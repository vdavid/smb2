# Changelog

All notable changes to smb2 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and we use
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Breaking: `Connection`'s send/receive API collapsed into `execute` / `execute_compound`** (Phase 3 of the
  actor refactor). The legacy `send_request`, `send_request_with_credits`, `send_compound`,
  `receive_response`, `receive_compound`, and `receive_compound_expected` are gone; callers use a single
  awaitable call per op. `Connection::execute(command, body, tree_id)` returns `Result<Frame>` where
  `Frame = { header, body, raw }`. `Connection::execute_compound(&[CompoundOp])` returns
  `Result<Vec<Result<Frame>>>` — the outer `Result` is "did the compound hit the wire", the inner one is
  per-sub-op so partial-failure handling (for example, `CREATE` ok, `READ` fails, issue standalone `CLOSE`
  with the returned `FileId`) is straightforward. `Connection: Clone`; clones share the receiver task so
  concurrent `execute` calls from different tasks/clones multiplex over the same SMB session. Cancelling
  (dropping) a future mid-flight is safe by construction — the matching late-arriving frame is discarded.
- `Connection` now uses a background receiver task with per-request `oneshot::Sender` routing (Phase 2 of
  the actor refactor). See `docs/specs/connection-actor.md`. A caller's dropped future (for example,
  `tokio::task::JoinHandle::abort()` in a downstream consumer) now correctly discards the corresponding
  late-arriving response instead of letting it pollute the next operation's receive. Credits still tick on
  dropped-caller frames so throughput stays correct under cancellation churn.
- `tokio` is formalized as a hard runtime requirement; added `"rt"` to the tokio feature set. The library
  spawns a receiver task per `Connection`.
- `MockTransport::receive()` now awaits via `tokio::sync::Notify` when the queue is empty instead of
  returning `Err(Disconnected)` immediately. Added `MockTransport::close()` to signal end-of-stream. This
  lets the background receiver task stay alive across a test's interleaved `queue_response` calls. External
  consumers writing tests with `MockTransport` directly need to call `close()` to get the old behavior.
- `MockTransport::enable_auto_rewrite_msg_id()` — opt-in test-mode shim that rewrites each zero-msg_id
  sub-frame of a queued response to match the next pending sent msg_id in FIFO order, so canned
  `build_*_response` helpers that hardcode `MessageId(0)` route through the Phase 3 receiver task without
  needing to predict the caller's allocated msg_ids. Replaces the pre-Phase-3
  `Connection::set_orphan_filter_enabled(false)` escape hatch.

### Migration guide (pre-Phase-3 → Phase 3)

Single request:
```rust
// Before
conn.send_request(Command::Create, &req, Some(tree_id)).await?;
let (header, body, _raw) = conn.receive_response().await?;
// After
let frame = conn.execute(Command::Create, &req, Some(tree_id)).await?;
// frame.header, frame.body, frame.raw
```

Compound request:
```rust
// Before
let ops = vec![(Command::Create, &create_req, CreditCharge(1)), /*...*/];
conn.send_compound(tree_id, &ops).await?;
let responses = conn.receive_compound_expected(3).await?;
// responses: Vec<(Header, Vec<u8>)>
// After
let ops = [
    CompoundOp { command: Command::Create, body: &create_req, tree_id: Some(tree_id), credit_charge: CreditCharge(1) },
    // ...
];
let frames = conn.execute_compound(&ops).await?;
// frames: Vec<Result<Frame>> — each entry may independently be Err (session expired, signature
// verify failure, etc.). Sub-op status codes (OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND and friends) ride in
// frames[i].as_ref()?.header.status, NOT in the inner Result.
```

Pipelined sliding-window reads/writes: use `futures_util::stream::FuturesUnordered` of boxed
`execute_with_credits` futures across `conn.clone()`s — see `src/client/tree.rs::read_pipelined_loop` for
the canonical pattern. `MAX_PIPELINE_WINDOW` and `conn.credits()`-based pacing stay on the caller side.

### Added

- `FileWriter::abort()` -- fast-cancel companion to `finish()`. Discards any unsent data, drains in-flight
  WRITE responses to keep credits and message IDs in sync, skips the server-side FLUSH (fsync), and does a
  best-effort CLOSE. Errors during drain/close are swallowed so callers can exit quickly. Use on
  cancellation or error paths where the partial remote file is going to be deleted anyway -- it saves the
  fsync round-trip vs. calling `finish()`. The caller is responsible for deleting the partial file.
- `Connection::receive_compound_expected(n)` -- gathers exactly `n` compound sub-responses, transparently
  reading additional transport frames when the server splits the chain. All compound-using methods
  (`read_file_compound`, `write_file_compound`, `fs_info`, `stat`, `rename`, `delete_file`/`delete_directory`,
  and the batch `delete_files`/`rename_files`/`stat_files`) now use it.

### Fixed

- Caller futures that get dropped mid-flight (for example, a cancelled listing task in a consuming
  application) no longer leave in-flight SMB requests on the wire that corrupt subsequent operations.
  The receiver task discards late-arriving frames whose waiter's `oneshot::Receiver` has been dropped.
  Reproduces and fixes the cmdr `listing_task.abort()` regression.
- Compound requests no longer error with `invalid_data: expected N compound responses, got M` when the
  server sends responses as separate frames instead of one compounded frame. Per MS-SMB2 3.3.4.1.3 the
  server SHOULD compound but MAY split, and Samba (including QNAP NAS firmware built on Samba) splits
  in some scenarios. Hit in the wild via `fs_info` against a QNAP NAS.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- `FileWriter` — push-based streaming write API with pipelined I/O. Consumer drives the loop, pushing chunks via
  `write_chunk()` with automatic backpressure (sliding window, credit-aware). Complement to `FileDownload` for reads.
  Created via `SmbClient::create_file_writer()`.
- 13 new Docker integration tests: basic, large (5 MB), empty, single byte, overwrite, equivalence with
  `write_file_pipelined`, binary data integrity, 64 KB max-write-size, signing, encryption, read-only rejection,
  100 MB stress (guest), 100 MB stress (200ms latency)
- 10 new unit tests for `FileWriter` pipelining, backpressure, chunk splitting, error handling

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- `write_file_streamed` — write files from a streaming callback source with pipelined I/O, bounded memory usage
  (sliding window, not full file), automatic chunk splitting at `MaxWriteSize`, works with signing and encryption
  ([f5ade78](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/f5ade78))
- 14 new tests: 3 unit (basic, empty, callback error), 9 Docker integration (guest, small, large 10 MB, empty, early
  stop, 64 KB max-write-size, mandatory signing, mandatory encryption, read-only rejection), 2 NAS integration
  (write + verify, performance comparison vs `write_file_pipelined`)

### Fixed

- Bumped `rand` 0.9.2 → 0.9.4 (RUSTSEC-2026-0097)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

  ([edcf730](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/edcf730))

### Fixed

- IOCTL `InputOffset` double-counted `Header::SIZE`, causing `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER` on DFS referral requests
  ([edcf730](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/edcf730))
- DFS paths missing `server\share` prefix in `Tree::format_path`
  ([edcf730](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/edcf730))

  ASN.1 dependency ([c27c88f](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/c27c88f))
- Kerberos crypto: AES-CTS (RFC 3962), RC4-HMAC (RFC 4757), PBKDF2 string-to-key, n-fold, HMAC-SHA1-96 checksums
  ([e23b851](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/e23b851))
- Kerberos ASN.1 messages: AS-REQ, TGS-REQ, AP-REQ, Authenticator, KDC-REP parsing — all hand-rolled DER
  ([97b57a5](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/97b57a5))

  ([01ad252](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/01ad252))

### Fixed

  ([3a63337](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/3a63337))
- AES-CTS key derivation: Ki constant is 0x55 (encrypt/decrypt integrity), not 0x99 (standalone checksum)
  ([661a245](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/661a245))
- TGS-REQ AP-REQ Authenticator was missing body checksum over KDC-REQ-BODY (RFC 4120 section 7.2.2, key usage 6)
  ([661a245](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/661a245))

### Key implementation details

Hard-won lessons from testing against Windows AD (documented in `src/auth/CLAUDE.md`):

- MS Kerberos OID (`1.2.840.48018.1.2.2`) required as primary SPNEGO mechanism for Windows
- Key usage 11 (not 7) for AP-REQ Authenticator encryption in SPNEGO exchanges
- GSS-API wrapping of AP-REQ inside SPNEGO mechToken
- Raw ticket byte pass-through (re-encoding corrupts the encrypted ticket)
- Session key etype detection from TGS-REP (may differ from ticket encryption type)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Compound requests — CREATE+READ+CLOSE (3-way) and CREATE+WRITE+FLUSH+CLOSE (4-way) as single transport frames,
  reducing round-trips from 3-4 to 1 per file operation
  ([a9293b6](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/a9293b6),
  [cb022bc](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/cb022bc))
- `read_file()` and `write_file()` auto-select compound (small) or pipelined (large) — callers don't choose

- Streaming download with `FileDownload`, progress reporting with `ControlFlow`-based cancellation
  ([c11f5f3](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/c11f5f3))
- Sliding window pipeline — each response immediately triggers the next chunk, keeping the TCP pipe full
  ([dd36181](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dd36181))
- SMB 3.x encryption wired into client layer — TRANSFORM_HEADER wrapping, sign-then-compress-then-encrypt send path,
  AES-128/256-CCM/GCM ([101d22d](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/101d22d))
- LZ4 compression wired into connection layer — negotiated during handshake, applied per-message when it reduces size
  ([e2921f9](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/e2921f9))
- File watching via `CHANGE_NOTIFY` — `Watcher` struct with `next_events()` long-poll, recursive watching support
  ([75b281d](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/75b281d))
- Disk space query (`fs_info`) via compound CREATE+QUERY_INFO+CLOSE
  ([6d3a05c](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/6d3a05c))

  ([f0b00cd](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/f0b00cd))

### Fixed

- `STATUS_PENDING` handling — `receive_response()` now loops past interim responses instead of treating them as errors
  ([8edf837](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/8edf837))
- Multi-credit charges — streaming download/upload and `write_file_with_progress` were sending `credit_charge=1` for
  MB-sized payloads, Samba rejects with `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER`
  ([8edf837](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/8edf837))
- Cipher fallback — fall back to AES-128-CCM when server omits encryption negotiate context
  ([812ad39](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/812ad39))

### Improved

- Smart read selection — sequential for files < MaxReadSize (1 RTT), pipelined only when beneficial
  ([3f0cd77](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/3f0cd77))
- Credit request bumped from 32 to 256 per request, credits grow rapidly
  ([dd36181](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dd36181))

- CLAUDE.md files for all 8 modules, agent docs colocated with code
  ([2d884d0](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/2d884d0))

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

  responses in offset order, handles out-of-order responses
  ([7f3068a](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/7f3068a))

  ([cbed0ab](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/cbed0ab))
- `SmbClient` high-level API — `connect()`, `list_shares()`, `connect_share()`, `reconnect()`, stored credentials
  ([cbed0ab](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/cbed0ab))

  small files 2-3x faster, medium files match native on upload, 8.5x faster than `smb` on download
  ([031d52b](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/031d52b),
  [4cbc961](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/4cbc961))
- Integration tests against QNAP NAS (SMB 3.1.1, NTLM, AES-GMAC) and Raspberry Pi 4 (SMB 3.1.1, guest)
  ([c80f126](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/c80f126))

### Fixed

- Preauth hash: exclude final SESSION_SETUP success response from hash — including it produces wrong keys for SMB 3.1.1
  ([32f0f30](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/32f0f30))
- QueryDirectory: cap `OutputBufferLength` to 65536, always send `"*"` pattern (empty filename rejected by QNAP + Samba)
  ([b9d49f7](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/b9d49f7))
- GMAC uses AES-128-GCM (16-byte key), not AES-256-GCM
  ([dc91351](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dc91351))
- GMAC nonce needs server role bit for response verification
  ([dc91351](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dc91351))
- Only verify signature when `SMB2_FLAGS_SIGNED` is set (skip STATUS_PENDING and oplock breaks)
  ([dc91351](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dc91351))
