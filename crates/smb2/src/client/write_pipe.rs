//! The engine every pipelined upload runs on.
//!
//! [`WritePipe`] sends the WRITEs of one open handle, paced by the same
//! `Window` a download uses (see `write_behind.rs` for what that means for an
//! upload), and bounded by the connection-wide write budget. `FileWriter`,
//! `FileUpload`, `Tree::write_file_pipelined`, `Tree::write_file_streamed`,
//! and `SmbClient::write_file_with_progress` all drive one, so an upload
//! paces the same way whichever of them started it. The handle's lifecycle
//! (CREATE, FLUSH, CLOSE) stays with the caller.
