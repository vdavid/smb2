//! How much an upload keeps on the wire.
//!
//! [`WriteBehind`] is the public knob. Every pipelined upload paces through
//! one engine (`write_pipe.rs`), which consults the same `Window` a download
//! does (`read_ahead.rs`): the arithmetic doesn't care which way the payload
//! flows, only when a request went out and when its bytes had arrived.
//!
//! # What a WRITE's answer measures
//!
//! A READ's answer carries the payload, so its arrival is the delivery. A
//! WRITE's answer is small and comes back after the payload went the other
//! way, so its arrival is the moment the server had every byte, plus the
//! server's own write and half a round trip. The gap between two answers is
//! the uplink's time for the second WRITE's bytes whenever that WRITE was
//! already queued behind the first, which is the same test the window applies
//! to READs (see `Window` § Measuring the link), so the arithmetic carries
//! over unchanged. Each answer is timed as the receiver task read it off the
//! wire, not when the upload looks at it: uploads are push-based, and a
//! producer busy elsewhere may not poll its answers for seconds.
//!
//! What can still make it read low, never high: **the answer shares the
//! downlink.** A download on the same connection queues the WRITE answers
//! behind its READ payload, and a slow server disk holds them back. Both look
//! like a slower uplink. Reading low keeps the window small, which errs toward
//! keeping the connection responsive.
//!
//! The rate is kept apart from the download one: an asymmetric link (most
//! home connections) moves each way at its own speed. So is the learned
//! headroom (`Window` § Learning the headroom): a confirmation that comes late
//! means the uplink sat idle or the server's disk held it, and either way the
//! window keeps more queued to cover the next one. A disk that stalls under
//! writes is exactly what that is for. On a 30 MB/s uplink it halves what a
//! `stat` waits behind an upload (70 ms against 142 ms, same throughput,
//! `results/self-tuning.md`), and at 3 MB/s / +60 ms a `stat` waits 161 ms
//! where 0.25.1's waited 343. An upload corrects what it estimates is still on
//! its way against the WRITEs actually unconfirmed
//! (`Window::with_unanswered_in_flight`): without that, the first WRITEs
//! after an idle spell, crossing in TCP slow start, left a surplus queued for
//! the rest of the file (1.5 MiB, a `stat` waiting ~520 ms).
//!
//! # Why adaptive is the default
//!
//! The same two constraints as for downloads (see [`crate::client::read_ahead`]):
//! a fast link needs bytes in flight, and on a slow one every queued byte is
//! latency for everything else on the connection. Before 0.25 a writer kept up
//! to 32 WRITEs of `MaxWriteSize` in flight (bounded at 32 MiB per connection
//! by the write budget), so a `stat` on the same connection waited behind all
//! of it: 23 s on a 375 KB/s uplink behind one 8 MiB file, and a Cmdr user's
//! 1 MiB frames sat 5–12 s in the send queue with every directory listing
//! behind them. The adaptive window keeps about `rate × (RTT + headroom)` in
//! flight instead: at least one WRITE, at most
//! [`ADAPTIVE_MAX_IN_FLIGHT`](crate::client::read_ahead::ADAPTIVE_MAX_IN_FLIGHT).
//!
//! Measured against Samba with the uplink shaped (`benchmarks/read-ahead/`,
//! `results/adaptive-uploads.md`, 2026-09-23), an 8 MiB upload against 0.24,
//! with the headroom then fixed at 250 ms:
//!
//! - **375 KB/s at +60 ms**: a `stat` on the same connection waits 1.5 s at
//!   most, down from 23.4 s, and a cancel is answered in 2.0 s, down from
//!   6.1 s. Same wall time.
//! - **3 MB/s at +20 ms**: a `stat` waits 370 ms at most, down from 2.9 s.
//! - **Fast links** keep their throughput: 100 MiB unshaped at 793 MB/s
//!   (0.24: 637), at +60 ms 45.6 MB/s (49.7), at +200 ms 16.0 MB/s (16.6),
//!   while the worst `stat` at +200 ms drops from 1.8 s to 416 ms. Doubling the
//!   cap to 8 MiB bought 2.5% at +200 ms for 50% more queue.
