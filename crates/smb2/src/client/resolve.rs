//! Which file, exactly, did the server open?
//!
//! A consumer enforcing a policy against a path needs the name the server
//! resolved it to, which is not always the name it asked for: an 8.3 alias
//! (`PROGRA~1`) and case folding (`readme.TXT` for `README.txt`) both open a
//! file under a name that says nothing client-side about which file it is.
//! [`Tree::resolve`] asks the server, in one round trip.
//!
//! ## Two ways to ask, and neither works everywhere
//!
//! - **`FileNormalizedNameInformation` (class 48, MS-FSCC § 2.4.35)** is the
//!   question this module wants answered: the path with every 8.3 component
//!   replaced by its long name and every component in its on-disk casing,
//!   relative to the share root (MS-SMB2 § 3.3.5.20.1 makes the server refuse
//!   it otherwise). Servers MUST refuse it on dialects 2.0.2, 2.1, and 3.0.2,
//!   and Windows answers it from 10 / Server v1803 on.
//! - **`FileAllInformation` (class 18)** carries a `FileNameInformation` too,
//!   and it is the fallback. ⚠️ A server SHOULD return that name EMPTY
//!   (MS-SMB2 § 3.3.5.20.1), and current Windows does. Only Windows
//!   2008–2012 R2 filled it, with an absolute path whose root the spec leaves
//!   open. So an empty name means "not answered", never "the share root", and
//!   a filled one is trusted only for as many trailing components as the
//!   caller asked for (see `name_from_all_information`).
//!
//! Measured 2026-09-23 on Samba 4.20.6 (the `smb-guest` fixture), Samba 4.22
//! (a Raspberry Pi), and a QNAP TS-464, all SMB 3.1.1, for a file created as
//! `smb2-probe-Dir/MixedCase Name.txt` and opened as
//! `SMB2-PROBE-DIR/mixedcase name.TXT`: class 48 answered
//! `smb2-probe-Dir\MixedCase Name.txt` (no leading `\`) and class 18
//! `\smb2-probe-Dir\MixedCase Name.txt`. Opening the Samba 8.3 alias
//! (`FileAlternateNameInformation`, class 21) and asking class 48 gave the
//! long name back.
//!
//! ## One compound, ordered for servers that cascade failures
//!
//! MS-SMB2 § 3.3.5.2.7.2 lets a server fail every related operation after a
//! failed one with the same status. So the order is: CREATE, the two queries
//! `stat` needs, class 18, the two identity queries, class 48, CLOSE. Class 48
//! goes last because it is the one most likely to fail (every Windows before
//! v1803), and a failure there must not take the metadata or the class 18
//! fallback with it. It still takes the CLOSE, which is why a CLOSE that did
//! not succeed gets a standalone one (pitfall 2).
//!
//! ## DFS
//!
//! On a DFS share the CREATE carries `server\share\path` (MS-SMB2 § 3.2.4.3),
//! but class 48 is relative to the share by definition, so it needs no
//! stripping. Class 18's trailing-component rule strips any prefix the server
//! puts in front. [`SmbClient::resolve`](crate::SmbClient::resolve) follows a
//! DFS link the way `stat` does, and the path it returns is then relative to
//! the TARGET share, which is the tree the caller holds afterwards.
