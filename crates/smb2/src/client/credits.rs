//! Connection-wide SMB2 credit accounting.
//!
//! A server hands the client a budget ("credits") and every request spends
//! from it: `CreditCharge = ceil(max(SendPayload, ExpectedResponse) / 65536)`,
//! at least 1 (MS-SMB2 § 3.1.5.2). Responses carry a `CreditResponse` grant
//! that puts credits back. A client that sends more than it holds is in
//! violation, and MS-SMB2 § 3.3.1.1 lets the server drop the connection —
//! some servers instead stop answering while the TCP socket stays open, which
//! looks exactly like a hung client.
//!
//! The budget is per *connection*, so it lives here rather than in any one
//! stream: several pipelined transfers over one connection draw on the same
//! pool.
//!
//! **NEGOTIATE is exempt, not funded.** Before the first grant a client may
//! send NEGOTIATE and nothing else (MS-SMB2 § 3.2.5.1.1). Modelling that as a
//! seeded permit in the pool is the trap: a permit is fungible, so a request
//! racing the handshake — a watcher re-arming, a listing retrying, anything
//! that arrives while a revived connection is re-negotiating — can spend it
//! and put a frame on the wire the server funded nothing for. The server
//! discards that frame in silence, so the client learns nothing and waits out
//! a full response deadline for an answer that was never coming. So the pool
//! starts EMPTY and NEGOTIATE carries a [`CreditReservation::exempt`], which
//! is the one shape nothing else can take.
//!
//! **Credits are spent on send, not on receipt.** That is the whole point of
//! this type. Accounting for a request only once its answer arrives leaves
//! everything currently in flight invisible, and concurrent senders each read
//! the same "plenty available" number and pile on.
//!
//! **A charge wider than the window fails at once, not after the deadline.**
//! Waiting only makes sense for a charge the server could still fund. One
//! wider than the whole window never can, and because the pool is fair it
//! doesn't wait alone: it soaks up every credit coming back, and every request
//! queued behind it on the connection waits with it. So the pool tracks the
//! window as well as what's unspent (see [`Window`]), and
//! [`CreditPool::can_never_fund`] answers from it.
//!
//! "The window" is every credit the server has handed out and not yet been
//! answered for: what's unspent plus what rides on requests still in flight.
//! It's what the server bounds (Samba's `smb2 max credits`, Windows'
//! `Smb2CreditsMax`), so it's also the most a single request can ever charge.
//! But a small window isn't a verdict on its own. Every request asks the server
//! to grow it (see [`CreditPool::request_for`]), and servers ramp: Windows
//! Server before 2016 grants 32 more at a time, and Samba declines to grow on
//! every session setup leg but the last, then grows on that one (Samba
//! `source3/smbd/smb2_server.c`, `smb2_set_operation_credit`, read on master
//! 2026-09-23; it also cuts the connection outright on a charge above its
//! maximum). So the window only has a CEILING once a response to a request
//! that asked for more came back granting no more than that request consumed,
//! and growth past that point takes the ceiling away again. Only a charge wider
//! than a known ceiling fails fast; anything else waits as before.
//!
//! Replies are read one at a time, but servers grant for several at once: a
//! compound's whole grant rides on one reply and the rest carry 0, and Samba
//! answers a pipeline at its maximum unevenly (one reply double, the next
//! nothing). So a 0 is no verdict either way, and growth only counts once it
//! exceeds the ceiling by more than what's still in flight
//! ([`Window::answer`]). Without both, any compound forgot a known ceiling.
//!
//! The ceiling also sizes the requests this crate picks the size of (chunks,
//! compound limits): see [`CreditPool::comfortable_charge`].
