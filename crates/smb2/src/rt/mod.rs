//! The async runtime underneath the client: spawning tasks, timers, and
//! sockets, on tokio or on smol.
//!
//! Everything in the crate that needs a running reactor goes through here.
//! What doesn't need one stays plain tokio on purpose: `tokio::sync`
//! (channels, semaphores, `Notify`) works on any executor.
//!
//! **A smol-only build is the proof.** It leaves tokio's `time`, `net`,
//! `io-util`, and `rt` features off, so a `tokio::time::sleep` or
//! `tokio::spawn` anywhere outside this module fails to compile there
//! instead of panicking at runtime. Keep that build in the checks.
//!
//! **Which backend runs a call is decided per call**, by [`backend`]: a tokio
//! runtime in reach wins, and without one the call runs on smol. So with only
//! one feature on there is nothing to decide, and with both on (feature
//! unification makes that common) each consumer gets the runtime it is
//! actually running on. A call only ever sees one backend, because a
//! connection's tasks, timers, and socket are all created from the same
//! context.
//!
//! See `CLAUDE.md` beside this file for the traps, the task-handle one first.
